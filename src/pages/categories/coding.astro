	description="Welcome to the coding section of my blog! Here, I mostly post about the updates I make to the site, and go into the technical details of my implementations. I also have some fun outside of this project with random things like making a video game about my cats and controlling a valve with a Raspberry Pi."
	background="My coding journey began on Neopets.com, where I first discovered web development through customizing my profile page with HTML and CSS. This early exposure sparked a lifelong interest in programming, though it would be years before I pursued it seriously. In 2019, I committed to learning modern web development, diving deep into JavaScript, React, and full-stack development. I built several projects to develop my skills, including the first version of this blog. That portfolio piece, along with other projects, helped me land my first role as a full-stack software engineer in 2021. Since then, I've continued expanding my knowledge, exploring everything from game development to IoT projects with Raspberry Pi. Each new technology I learn reinforces my passion for coding and problem-solving."
