	description="Welcome to the gardening section of my blog! Here, I plant flowers to create a more vibrant space, grow fruits and vegetables using companion planting techniques, and slowly improve the sustainability of my garden."
	background="My gardening journey began in Boston, where I transformed a sunny apartment balcony into a thriving container garden. Using fabric planters, I experimented with everything from leafy greens to root vegetables, learning valuable lessons about urban gardening along the way. I became particularly fascinated with companion planting - strategically grouping plants that benefit each other. What started as a modest balcony garden has now evolved into several raised beds, where I continue to apply and expand upon the knowledge I gained from those early container gardening days. Each season brings new challenges and discoveries as I work to create a more sustainable and productive garden space."
