	description="Welcome to the crafts section of my blog! Here, I do a bunch of random things, from cross stitch to woodworking. I really like making home accents, especially wall art. I also enjoy building things outside for my garden!"
	background="My crafting journey began in childhood, creating alongside my mom and joining my elementary school's knitting club. While I took a break during my early teens, rediscovering knitting in high school opened up a whole new world of possibilities. What started with simple projects evolved into creating intricate purses, cozy afghans, and even wearable pieces like sweaters. To expand my fiber arts repertoire, I taught myself crochet, which complemented my knitting skills perfectly. During the 2020 lockdown, I embraced needlework, learning embroidery and falling in love with the timeless charm of cross stitch. Most recently, I've ventured into woodworking under my dad's guidance, combining this skill with my needle arts by creating custom frames for my pieces and building functional structures for my garden. Each craft I learn builds upon the others, creating a rich tapestry of skills that allow me to bring my creative visions to life."
