    *The Good Lie* is a thriller mystery: a psychiatrist who specializes in people with violent tendencies helps a laywer figure out who kidnapped and murdered his son. The book is well written and a page turner, and I never expected the ending. I'm super excited to reading more of A.R. Torre's work!

    *Survive the Night* is a thriller about a college student who gets a ride home from a stranger. Oh, and there is a killer on the loose who targets college students. I enjoyed the book, but in my opinion the writing was poor and there were too many twists and turns in a short span of pages.

  <div>
    *The Mountain in the Sea* is about what it means to have consciousness and how language shapes our view of the world.  I thought the ideas were interesting and thought provoking, but the book was really repetitive and not much actually happened. Still, I enjoyed the book, and after talking with one of my coworkers, I think I'll give it another shot. My favorite takeaways from this book are that our language completely shapes and limits our ability to understand the world, and that we should be more open to the idea that we are not the center of the universe.

    *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* is about a post-apocalyptic future where humans have left Earth and androids have taken over. The protagonist is a bounty hunter who is tasked with finding and "retiring" androids. All he wants is a real animal, but he can only afford an electric sheep. One of my favorite books of all time, this makes you think about what it means to have consciousness and what it means to be human. This is the book the Blade Runner movies are based on, albeit a bit more of a humorous tone.

    In *Dawn*, the protagonist is a human who is saved from the nuclear wasteland of Earth by aliens. These aliens are "gene traders" who evolve by mixing their genes with other species. Although the aliens do not lie, they only tell half-truths about what will happen to the remaining few humans. Another one of my favorite books, this is a great novel about humanity fighting for survival, but needing to change in order to do so.

    *Annihilation* is a science fiction novel about a team of scientists who are sent to an area of the world to investigate the effects of a mysterious anomoly called Area X. Creepy and intriguing, I enjoyed this book much more than the first time I read it. It was fast paced, suspenseful, and creepy. Also different from the movie, this book focuses on something called the Tower, a mysterious structure that is the may be the source of the anomaly.

    *Authority* is the sequel to *Annihilation*. I don't want to spoil the first book, but I thought this one was a lot more dull until about 70% of the way through it. Overall, though, I enjoyed it, and I am planning on reading the third in the series.

    *Klara and the Sun* is about an android named Klara who worships the sun. She is bought by a family to be the "Artificial Friend" to a young, sickly girl. This book is a great story about companionship, loneliness, and hope. It is written from the perspective of Klara, so you get to see the world the way she sees it: hopeful and innocent.
