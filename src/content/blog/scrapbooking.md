After visiting my grandparents in Mississippi, I was inspired to get back into printing photos for my photo albums. Scrapbooking was always something I have wanted to do, so instead of buying a new photo album when I ran out of space for my new photos, I decided to start scrapbooking!

There are pages and pages of cat photos. They truly are my babies ‚ù§Ô∏èüå∏

And of course I can't help myself but to go overboard. My two binders I bought are already full! The first binder is from college, and the second album is Boston and beyond. I hope to get a third album for before college.

For now, the pages are mostly filled with pictures, but I am going back through and adding little notes and descriptions as well. I have some trinkets saved that I've also put in the pages!

Going through these old photos is helping me process my memories and reflect on good and bad times. I've learned so much about myself the last few years, and I hope that 2024 is a spectacular year.
