Hello, friends! Long time no see ðŸŒ¸ I've been jumping from hobby to hobby lately, not able to finish anything before I start something else. It's quite frustrating, but I am slowly making progress on a bunch of things at once.

One of the things I've been working on is a game called Poppy's Playground! It is written in [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)), and is pretty simple so far. Basically, you are my cat Poppy, and you are trying to collect cookies without getting caught by the evil Tiger.

I haven't deployed the game anywhere yet because I'll need to set up a server to host the game, and those are expensive to run.

Future ideas include:
- Selecting a player at the beginning of the game (Poppy, Buddy, or Ray). Each player has different stats
- A high score board
- Adding tiger to chase the player
- Allowing the player to jump on furniture to get away from Tiger
- Adding catnip to give the player a boost
- Putting the game on a server to embed on this website

So there's still a lot of work to do before it's an actual, like, fun game, but it's coming along, and I've learned a lot about Lua! [Click here for the source code!](https://github.com/hwilloug/poppys-playground)
