I was in the mood to do some watercolor ribbon embroidery, so I made a couple of pieces. It was hard to choose the right frame for each, so I went thrifting and found some!

## Watercoloring

I first embroidered with white ribbon.

Then, I watercolored each flower. Below is just getting started on the tulips.

## Framing

It was hard to choose a frame, but I was able to find some for cheap at my favorite local thrift store, [Pawsabilities](https://humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org/about-hsyc/our-locations/location-pawsibilities-thrift-store.html).

This is the original frame I used for the tulip piece.

I decided this frame was too simple for it, so I went with something a bit more ornate for the final look:

For the lily piece, I found a simple frame that I thought was pretty enough.

## Finishing

To finish each piece, I cut out a piece of cardboard to fit the frame and sewed it in place.

## Conclusion

That's all I have for now! I'm going to keep working on my watercolor ribbon embroidery and see where it takes me. I'm also going to keep thrifting for frames and see what I can find.

These pieces will eventually be for sale at my local coffee shop, [Humble Cup Coffee](https://www.humblecupcoffeeco.com/). I've got a cherry blossom piece for sale there now, so head on over check it out.
