Long time no see! This article is a little late and more of a photo dump, but I wanted to wait until after I had given the gifts to share with you all. Each of these gifts was made with love, and everyone really seemed to enjoy them.

## Cross Stitch Pieces

These are mini Pokémon cross stitch pieces that I made for my siblings. It's each of their favorite Pokémon (Snorlax, Lucario, and Turtwig). I found these frames at a vintage market in Charlotte, NC. The patterns come from the actual sprites from the games, and I think they are super cute.

Above is a bird cross stitch piece that I made for my partner's mom. I found the pattern on Pinterest and modified it a little bit to make it more my style. I made the frame myself as well.

This cigar and bourbon cross stitch piece was for my partner's dad. I found the pattern on Pinterest and modified it a bit to be simpler. I made the frame for this one too.

The above piece is a barnyard cross stitch that I made for my grandmother. This pattern is completely my own, and I am really proud of it. The barn and the farm plots were tedious, but it came together really nicely. I made the frame myself as well.

## Embroidery

This cotton embroidery was a gift for my aunt. Unfortunately, I didn't use real cotton (it's polyester), but I think it still looks exactly like cotton. I found this idea on Pinterest. And, I made the frame for this piece too.

I embroidered the above sweatshirt for my partner. We are both obsessed with trout, so this piece was perfect for him. I used a combination of patterns that I found on Pinterest. The only thing I would change about this piece is the color of the head. I ran out of the green thread, so I used a different color, which didn't turn out as well.

## Ribbon Embroidery

The above piece was my first attempt at watercolor ribbon embroidery. I used white ribbon, then watercolored them. This was for my friend Rachel.

This Lily of the Valley ribbon embroidery was for my sibling, and I love how it turned out. Seeing this flower in ribbon was what actually got me interested in doing ribbon embroidery. The flowers are actually 3D because I used large French knots underneath the petals. The hardest part was getting the wider ribbon to go through the fabric (I had to use pliers, lol).

![Hibiscus Ribbon Embroidery](https://blog-images.poppyland.dev/holiday_2024_6.jpeg)

This hibiscus was my second attempt at ribbon embroidery. I couldn't believe that I made this. Again, I used white ribbon, then watercolored it. I made the details from one strand of thread to give it a delicate look, and added beads for the center. This was for my friend Kim.

![Tulip Ribbon Embroidery](https://blog-images.poppyland.dev/holiday_2024_8.jpeg)

Finally, this tulip embroidery was for my friend Jen. I did the same thing as previously mentioned: white ribbon then watercolored. I used red for the edges of the petals, but when it mixed with the yellow, somehow it turned pink.
