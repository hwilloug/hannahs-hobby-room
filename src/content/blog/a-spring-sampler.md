I made a spring sampler cross stitch for my mom! I used this pattern: [Spring Band Sampler](https://www.everythingcrossstitch.com/spring-band-sampler-mrp-p32517.aspx). Below are the pictures of it in progress:

## What's Next
Since the dimensions are not normal for a regular picture frame, I plan on building a custom frame. I borrowed a router from my dad, and am planning on starting it this week! Then, the piece will be done. I plan on giving it to my mom to match the squirrel sampler I made her for Christmas ❤️
