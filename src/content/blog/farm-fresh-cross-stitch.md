Long time no see! I finally finished a cross-stitch project that I've been putting off for a while. I was inspired to do this piece by my garden, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. I used a pattern from [this site](https://www.123stitch.com/item/Country-Cottage-Needleworks-Farm-Fresh-Cross-Stitch-Pattern/12-2208)!

## The Cross Stitch

This is the piece in progress. I used 14 count cloth and (mostly) DMC floss. The 14 count cloth is a good size such that I can see the holes, and therefore, where the crosses should go.

I wasn't sure I'd be able to get through the canpoy because it was pretty tedious, but it didn't end up being too bad. I really like the depth that the slight change in shade gives the canopy.

And here's the finished piece! My favorite part of making this was stitching the vegetables. I feel like doing that part really brought everything together and encouraged me to continue working on it.

## Framing

I had this green frame that was perfect for this piece. I found it at [Pawsibilities](https://humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org/about-hsyc/our-locations/location-pawsibilities-thrift-store.html), a thrift store in Fort Mill. I loved the color of this frame, so snagged it for a time when I'd have a project that suits it. I also like the sizing of the frame because of the amount of margin it leaves, and I think the color really makes it pop!

## The Final Result

Here's the final result! I hung it up in my dining room ðŸŒ¸

## What I'd Do Differently
- Make the text smaller so I could include the chickens from the original design.
- Use a darker shade of cloth. I think shade I picked was a little too light, and I would have rather had the clouds pop.

## Sneak Peek

Here's a sneak peak of my next project. What could it be??
